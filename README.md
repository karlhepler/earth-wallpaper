# earth-wallpaper
This downloads the latest image of the earth from NOAA and sets it as your MacOSX desktop background.

## TODO
* Figure out how to make sure the wallpaper is center scaled with a black background. [Here's an idea](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/22301/setting-desktop-picture-to-be-centered-with-a-specific-background-color)
* Multi-monitor support. It would be nice to maybe only show a particular region on one monitor and the entire earth on a different monitor. [More information here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141834/applescript-to-change-desktop-image-on-all-monitors#308843).
